The backend API endpoints follow CRUD principles, with functions for creating, reading,
updating, and deleting user information. Users are initialized with a username, password,
and email. The API keeps logs of current and past scores, as well as the number of logins
by a user. GET endpoints can return a specific user by database ID and username for
versatility, and PATCH endpoints update information by database ID as well.
