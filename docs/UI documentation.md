# UI Documentation

The Game UI utilizes Bluma CSS styling, accessible [here](https://bulma.io/documentation/)

Custom stylization was written for the game cards, menu sidebar, and profile data tabs.

The login page features custom styling for the entire creation with the blackjack.png file within our repository acting as the backdrop.

For all stylization concerns regarding our game UI, refer to the bluma documentation or to our comments within the blackjack.js file.
