## :clubs: Game Rules:
In this game, you and a computer adversary play the game of Blackjack. 

You both are dealt two cards from a standard deck of 52 shuffled cards. The goal is to get as close to (but not over!) 21 when summing the value of your hand. 

In some games, the Ace means 11 or 1, but to keep it simple here, we've decided Ace only means 11. 

You will go first, and can choose to either "Hit" or "Stay": 
- If you select "Hit", you will be dealt another card, which adds to the total sum of your hand. 
- If you select "stay", you will end your turn with the cards you have, prompting the computer's turn. Whoever gets closer to 21 without going over wins!

## :computer: Using the Game
1. Clone the repository
2. Install bulma; **npm install bulma** to ensure stylistic consistency on devices 
3. Run **npx browser-sync start -sw** to launch the game browser in a new tab
4. Select the menu bar in the top left corner of the window and select logout
5. On this sign in page, select **create a new profile** and fill in the associated fields
6. Once you have registered, log in using your account info
7. Return to the game board by selecting the menu button in the top left corner of the window once again

## 	:warning: Important Note:
If at any point you have issues logging in or registering, or would simply like to play the game without using a player profile, simply exit the browser and rerun the browser-sync start command. Then, once the page opens, you can play on the gameboard without navigating elsewhere. Doing so will mean your player ID during the game will show "Undefined", and your score history will not be maintained.
